### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Harshit Ratan Shukla, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with hands-on experience working on real-world projects using React.js, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, LangChain, Mistral AI, RAG-based AI agents, and many more modern technologies. On the backend, I also work extensively with Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and ORM tools to build scalable, high-performance APIs and microservices.

I enjoy crafting intelligent, end-to-end solutionsâ€”from dynamic UIs to robust backend systems, seamlessly integrated with AI, vector search, and modern architecture patterns.
